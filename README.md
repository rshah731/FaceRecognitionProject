Built a computer vision model using Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and face-recognition libraries to detect and identify faces in real time.
Automated attendance tracking via CSV data logging, integrating timestamped event recording for recognized faces.
Improved recognition speed and accuracy through frame-by-frame optimization, data preprocessing with NumPy arrays, and use of pretrained models.
